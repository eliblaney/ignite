# Why should I do Ignite?

There are a lot of reasons you won’t want to do Ignite. You’ll have to give up things you find pleasure in like TV, late nights, and scrolling through your feeds. You may find daily prayer boring, especially at first. You’ll meet regularly with a group, even if there are other things you’d rather do. But there are reasons to do it anyway.

Discernment, the process of prayerfully making decisions, is a vital part of Ignite. It’s so important that it actually begins right now, as you discern whether or not God is calling you to this retreat. To help your discernment, take a moment to clear your mind of distractions, ask the Holy Spirit for guidance, and ask yourself these questions.

* Do I feel rushed as go about my day?
* Do I want to pray more than I do right now?
* Do I wish I knew what God wants me to do with my life?
* Do I fill up my day with little things instead of doing what’s important to me?
* Am I looking for new ways to pray?
* Am I distracted a lot of the time?
* Should I take better care of my body?
* Do I get chances to talk to my friends about things that are important to me?
* Do I want to learn more about how Ignatian Spirituality really works?
* Is my day to day life often unfulfilling?
* Do I want to get to know Jesus more personally?
* Do I have any bad or sinful habits I want to escape from?
* Am I concerned about the negative effects my lifestyle might have on creation?
* Is God calling me to do more to serve him?

Continue to think and pray about any of these questions that struck you.
