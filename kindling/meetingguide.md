# Ignite Meeting Guide

Meeting with your community weekly is a core component of the Ignite retreat. It reminds you that you're not alone in your journey towards a deeper relationship with God Below is a guide to help your meetings flow.

Your very first meeting should be shortly before your community starts the retreat, (see the [first meeting guide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=115ZJzu_mfFE3Ajb5YRfhSCiAGdyuD-fBH3mkq4TiGVs)) so that you can determine your fasts with our Fasting Guide. Aside from the first meeting, your meetings can follow any format you like, so long as the whole community has an opportunity to pray together and each member has an opportunity to share both consolations and desolations. Consolations refer to “every increase of hope, faith and charity, and all interior joy which calls and attracts to heavenly things and to the salvation of one’s soul, quieting it and giving it peace in its Creator and Lord” (Exercises). Desolations are experiences of being “without hope, without love, when one finds oneself all lazy, tepid, sad, and as if separated from ones Creator and Lord” (Exercises). Put simply, they are spiritual highs and lows. A typical meeting might last about an hour.

#### Here's how a meeting might look:

**1.** Begin by praying together. You might use this Prayer before a Meeting, or another way of praying.

_O Spirit of God, we ask you to help orient
all our actions by your inspirations,
carry them on by your gracious assistance,
that every prayer and work of ours
may always begin from you
and through you be happily ended_

**2.** Each person gives a word describing “How are you coming?”

**3.** Share a consolation of the week

**4.** Share a desolation of the week

**5.** Each person gives a word describing “How are you leaving?”

**6.** One member gives a closing prayer, the Prayer for Generosity below is excellent for the whole group to pray together, but any form of prayer will do. 

_Lord Jesus, teach me to be generous; 
teach me to serve you as you deserve, 
to give and not to count the cost, 
to fight and not to heed the wounds, 
to toil and not to seek for rest, 
to labor and not to seek reward, 
except that of knowing that I do your will._
