# Guide to Fasting

_“God_ _created_ _human_ _beings_ _to_ _praise,_ _reverence,_ _and_ _serve_ _God,_ _and_ _by_ _doing_ _this,_ _to_ _save_ _their_ _souls._ _God_ _created_ _all_ _other_ _things_ _on_ _the_ _face_ _of_ _the_ _earth_ _to_ _help_ _fulfill_ _this_ _purpose._ _From_ _this_ _it_ _follows_ _that_ _we_ _are_ _to_ _use_ _the_ _things_ _of_ _this_ _world_ _only_ _to_ _the_ _extent_ _that_ _they_ _help_ _us_ _to_ _this_ _end,_ _and_ _we_ _ought_ _to_ _rid_ _ourselves_ _of_ _the_ _things_ _of_ _this_ _world_ _to_ _the_ _extent_ _that_ _they_ _get_ _in_ _the_ _way_ _of_ _this_ _end.”_ _—St. Ignatius of Loyola_

You just read St. Ignatius’s first principle and foundation, the basis for all of Ignatian spirituality. It can be helpful to think of it like a campfire. The flame is our relationship with God, warming and illuminating us. The sticks and logs are the things God created for us:  our talents, tools, toys and time, that are meant to fuel that fire of love and grace. As long as we feed the fire it will continue to burn brightly in us, but gradually we move away from the fire and forget how bright and warm it is. We become attached to the wood, not wanting to see it be burned, and the fire grows dim, so it no longer seems worth our effort anyway. Our wood begins to rot, and we grow cold.

Fasting is the courageous action of letting go of our old, rotting wood to reignite the fire of God in our hearts. But it must be done carefully. These six principles can make sure you don’t get burnt when you fast.

One: **Detachment**. Fasting in Ignite is not about self-punishment. These fasting practices are exercises in detachment, simplicity, responsible relationship with creation, and opportunities for good action, all of which serve to foster relationships with God. If your fasting is about nothing more than sin, then your relationship with God cannot grow past apologizing.

Two: **Health**. Fasting should make you holy, not unhealthy. St. Ignatius himself did serious damage to his health by fasting excessively in his youth, and taught his Jesuits the importance of moderation that he learned the hard way. Before you begin Ignite, discuss with your group if there are any practices that may not be feasible and what exceptions you may need to make for the success and well-being of your members. For example, it may not be feasible to totally give up social media if you run a facebook page for a student org, but you might set a timer to limit yourself. If you’re taking a film class you’ll have to watch some movies over the course of the semester. If your friend group uses snapchat to keep in touch you may need to use it if they don’t want to accommodate your fast. Don’t rob yourself of a rich experience by making up excuses, but don’t die by the letter of the law either. Fasting should be a challenge, and it should be uncomfortable, but if at any point you notice that any of your fasting practices are damaging to your physical, social, mental, emotional, or spiritual health, talk with a spiritual director and/or your group to determine if that practice can be altered into a healthier form or if it should be set aside.

Three: **Humility**. Jesus instructs his disciples, “when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face, so that it will not be obvious to others that you are fasting, but only to your Father, who is unseen; and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.” (Mt 6:17-18). Fasting is only the fuel for the flame of prayer. Avoid mentioning your fasting to other people without cause, and focus on the prayer and community which are the more important foundations of Ignite.

Four: **Be gentle with yourself.** You might fail in your fasting, and that’s okay. Fasting reveals how much you depend on God, not how holy you are.

Five: **You’re not alone.** If you are struggling with fasting in any way, then pray about it and talk to your companion, your group, a priest, campus minister, spiritual director, counselor, or trusted faith leader.

Six: **Joy.** Remember that you are not just giving things up, you are gaining something too. Look for the unexpected graces that could come from your new freedoms and express gratitude for them.

### Fasting Practices

Fasting in Ignite involves **Group Practices**, **Personal Practices**, and **Generosity Practices**.

*Group Practices:* Everyone who does Ignite participates in giving up these attachments. Most of them are not inherently bad, but they are an obstacle to the time, space, and quiet needed for prayer and community during Ignite.

* _Fast from_ **Social Media.** The intention is to be free from the incessant judgements, toxicity, noise, and false perfection of feeds. If you use DM’s to keep in touch, invite your friends to use text or email instead.
* _Fast from_ **TV, movies, streaming services, and videogames.** There’s nothing wrong with these things, but Ignite invites you to be more active in the ways you spend your time.
* _Fast from_ **unnecessary use of electronics.** Only use your computer and phone for work, school, or essential tasks. Doing Ignite doesn’t mean going back to the dark ages, but being constantly plugged in makes it easy to be distracted. When you begin, decide what counts as “necessary” for your group. You won’t die without Twitter, but often personal communication apps are necessary to keep in touch with busy friends. If you allow groupchats, calls, or texts, use the following guide to keep them in healthy moderation. 

When possible, communicate face-to-face.

If you can’t talk in person, use a phone call.

If you can’t call, then use text. The rule of thumb is to keep your communication as complete and personal as possible.

* _Fast from_ **Alcohol, drugs, smoking, and vaping.** These dependencies represent attachments that detract from the presence of mind needed for prayer and free decision making. If you find yourself too attached or addicted to complete this fast, don’t give up, but seek out a spiritual director, counselor and/or additional support.
* _Fast from_ **Sleepiness.** Get a good night’s rest each night, for most people at least 7 hours. A good relationship with God also requires alertness and care for the body and God gave you. If you find yourself unable to both complete your prayer and get enough sleep, examine your day to see where you might make time for both.
* _Fast from_ **Pornography.** Porn seeks an addicting, inauthentic attachment that damages your freedom and the dignity of all persons involved. If you struggle with porn, the other fasts can help develop the will needed to break free, but it is best to install website blockers and seek out a spiritual director, counselor, or other guide to give yourself every advantage against the addiction.


*Personal Practices:* Each person has their own attachments, pleasures they feel they can’t live without, and habits that prevent them from being totally free. At the end of the first week you will be prompted to choose additional fasts that fit your own spiritual needs. Remember that an attachment is not something bad in itself, it is something that we use to replace God. Examine your life for things you do for pleasure that leave you feeling empty, that keep you struggling for fulfillment instead of resting in God. This list provides some common practices, but you can choose attachments in your life that are not on the list. It is possible to do all of them, but choose no more and no less than your prayerful discernment leads you to. Keep the list in mind during the first week so that you will be ready to choose by the end.

* Take short, cold or lukewarm showers
* Practice regular, rigorous exercise (at least once a week)
* Fast from desserts and sweets
* Fast from eating between meals
* Fast from sweetened drinks
* Fast from headphones
* Fast from meat one day each week or through the entirety of Ignite
* Fast from gossip
* Fast from driving. Walk, use public transportation, or carpool instead.
* Fast from climate comfort. If your roommate is also on board, turn your heating to a cooler setting and use warmer clothes and blankets instead.

Sunday: Sundays are a day of celebration, so for that one day each week you can enjoy whatever **personal practices** you decide to give up. However, because the **group practices** are necessary for a deeper attitude of prayer, you should continue to keep those fasts even on Sunday.

*Generosity Practices:* This set of practices has only one rule, *do* *anything* *that* *allows* *you* *to* *turn* *fasting* *into* *action* *that* *serves* *the* *greater* *glory* *of* *God*. Fasting frees you from spending time and money that could be used setting the world on fire. There are lots of ways to turn your fasting into generosity. You can keep track (at least roughly) the amount of money you save by fasting and donate it to a charitable cause. You can estimate how much time you are no longer spending on entertainment and use some of that time for service. If you are on a meal plan, you can use any surplus dining dollars to buy and donate nonperishable food.
